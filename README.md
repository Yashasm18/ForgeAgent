# ForgeAgent — verified skill memory for AI agents

> GPT-5.6 may propose a new agent capability. ForgeAgent decides whether it has
> earned trust.

Long-running agents need to acquire small capabilities as work changes, but
blindly executing generated code creates a memory full of unproven behavior.
ForgeAgent turns each capability gap into a disciplined loop: **propose →
policy-check → isolate → prove → persist → reuse**.

## Why it matters

An agent can now get better over time without quietly accumulating unverified
code. Every saved skill has source, deterministic test evidence, provenance,
reuse history, and an append-only decision record. Broken or policy-violating
candidates are rejected before they can enter memory.

## Quick demo (no API key)

```bash
python3 main.py --demo --reset
python3 main.py --demo
python3 main.py --serve
python3 main.py --benchmark
python3 main.py --showcase --reset
python3 main.py --autonomy-demo --reset
python3 main.py --autonomy-demo
python3 main.py --compare
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` to see the **Forge Ledger**. The first demo run
creates two curated offline skills; the second proves that verified memory is
reused. The curated mode is intentionally labelled as a recording fallback—it
does not claim to be a live model call.

The dashboard now also shows the **Evidence Trail**: every capability request,
policy rejection, verification result, trusted reuse, and execution is stored
in `data/audit_log.jsonl`.

`--benchmark` evaluates the trust gate against five representative cases:
safe code, filesystem access, network access, dynamic execution, and a broken
tool contract. `--showcase` is the recording-ready workflow: redact sensitive
support data, explain customer risk, and reuse those proven capabilities on the
next pass.

## Capability Graph and task recovery

ForgeAgent's capability graph is its native memory model. It maps user tasks
to capability gaps, verified skill versions, proof evidence, dependencies,
repairs, supersessions, and rollbacks. It is not a generic codebase graph: it
answers **why this agent can safely perform this task now**.

`--autonomy-demo` runs a dependent incident workflow. Each step first looks
for an active trusted skill. A gap triggers forging; a failed proposal triggers
up to two repair attempts; only a repaired candidate that passes every test is
promoted. Verified replacement versions retain the older version for rollback.

`--compare` executes the same multi-step workflow twice as a stateless agent
and twice with ForgeAgent's persistent memory, reporting new-skill creation,
reuse, and elapsed time.

With an OpenAI API key, ForgeAgent can also receive an unknown user task and
ask GPT-5.6 to produce the dependency plan itself:

```bash
python3 main.py --autonomous-task "Redact this incident, assess its customer risk, and summarize recurring terms" \
  --payload '{"text":"Ava at ava@example.com cannot access the dashboard and may cancel."}'
```

For each planned step, a missing capability triggers code-and-test generation;
a failed candidate triggers repair attempts; an accepted repair creates a new
version while preserving the earlier trusted version for rollback.

## Live GPT-5.6 forge

Set an OpenAI API key, then ask ForgeAgent for a genuinely new capability:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
python3 main.py --forge "Extract order IDs, normalize their case, and return unique values" \
  --payload '{"text":"Orders: ab-12, AB-12 and xy-99"}'
```

ForgeAgent asks GPT-5.6 to return a constrained `run(payload)` function plus
edge-case tests. It performs AST policy checks and runs every test in a fresh,
timeout-bounded subprocess. Only a passing candidate is stored in
`data/tool_registry.json` and becomes reusable.

## Test

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Safety scope

This is defense in depth for a hackathon project, not hardened containment for
hostile code. Generated tools run in a fresh subprocess with a timeout, a
temporary working directory, a minimal environment, a restricted builtins set,
and an import/operation policy. The policy gate is exposed separately before
execution and every decision is recorded. Production deployment would require
stronger OS/container isolation, network controls, and human review policies.

## OpenAI Build Week evidence

ForgeAgent is entered in **Developer Tools**. See [HACKATHON_SCOPE.md](HACKATHON_SCOPE.md)
for the boundary between the earlier prototype and Build Week work.

Codex accelerated the architecture, safety lifecycle, dashboard, tests, and
submission materials. GPT-5.6 is used at runtime to propose constrained tool
code and its deterministic test cases. The demo video will show both the
successful forge path and a deliberate policy/test rejection.

## Judge testing path

- Supported platform: macOS, Linux, or Windows with Python 3.10+.
- Dependencies: none beyond the Python standard library.
- Offline proof: `python3 main.py --demo --reset`.
- Live GPT-5.6 proof: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and use `--forge` as above.
- Visual inspection: `python3 main.py --serve`.
